This is the testing blog post which I'll be using to test the comments as well
as deployment of zola on Github pages.

This blog is built using [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and [Hook theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/hook/).
I also used a [neat trick by Frederick Banning](https://fbanning.de/thoughts/mastodon-comments-on-zola-blog/)
to be able to comment and see comments under the blog posts.

Hello, world!
